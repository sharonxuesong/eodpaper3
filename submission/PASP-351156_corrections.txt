Thank you for sending the proof of manuscript 351156. Please find our corrections below. We also have some other minor corrections and additions to the paper, which are listed at the end.
Please email Sharon Wang at cfaxuesong@gmail.com in case of questions.

Corrections regarding the proof:

1. The short title should be 'Exoplanet Orbit Database II'. No periods after 'Database' or 'II' unless they were added to comply with publishing styles. If periods were added for style purposes only they we confirm the short title.

2. Please modify the beginning of first sentence of the second paragraph of Section 1 Introduction into:
"This paper describes our continuing efforts since Butler et al. (2002, 2006) and Wright et al. (2011)â€¦"
i.e. citing both Butler et al. 2002 and Butler et al. 2006.
This also means putting the Butler et al. 2002 reference back to the reference list:
Butler, R.~P., et al. 2002, ApJ, 578, 565

Please modify the texts in the abstract into:
"The EOD descends from a table provided by Butler and coworkers in 2002 and the Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets (Butler and coworkers in 2006), and the first complete documentation for the EOD and the EDE was presented by Wright and coworkers in 2011."
i.e. adding the years.

3. We confirm the keyword choice.

4. The example CSV file contains a table. It was submitted together with the paper. The filename is exoplanets.csv.
Please list it with the online material as an online table.
Please modify the reference to this file in the introduction to:
"An example of this CSV file is available with the electronic version of this paper (filename: exoplanets.csv)."
If the above is inappropriate, we are fine with other ways of referencing this file that complies with publishing styles.

5. Please modify CNE to "Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets (Butler et al. 2002)".

6. Please modify the sentence containing 'ADS' into:
"(e.g., the URLs for the papers providing the underlying data linked to their SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System, i.e. ADS, entries)"

7. We confirm with the changes (removal of italic style).

8. We confirm the dates of the citations in footnote 10.

9. Please change 'Lambda is used' into 'The angle $\lambda$ is used' so that it is still lowercase greek letter lambda but no longer leads the sentence.

10. The figures are wrong. We agree with switching the numbering of Figure 2 and 3. However, only the captions are swapped - the figures are not. Please also switch the figures (Figure 2 should be the one with circles, and Figure 3 is a screen capture with a plot of dots and triangles etc.).

11. Please replace "IRAC" with "InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC)".

12. Please replace "NStED" with "the NASA Star and Exoplanet Database (NStED)".

13. Please replace "CDS, Strasbourg, France" with "the Centre de Donn\'ees astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS), France".

14. We confirm the removal of these unused references from the citation list.


Other corrections:

1. In Section 2.2, on the left side of Page 6, in the first equation, on the fourth line under the condition of 6 R_Earth < R < b, please change M_{\rm M} to \min{(M_{\rm M}, M_{\rm Jup})}.

2. In Section 2.2, on the left side of Page 6, in the second equation which comes after "from Weiss & Marcy (2014) and is given by:", the first condition should be R < 1.5 R_\oplus (i.e. "R < 1.5 R_Earth"), i.e., please eliminate the "R_Earth <=" part on the first line of this equation.

3. Also in Section 2.2, left side of Page 6, in the table at the bottom of the page, the column headers for the tables should be:
$a/{\rm AU} \leq 0.1$ 
for the second column, and
$a/{\rm AU} > 0.1$
for the third column.

Additions to the acknowledgement:

1. Please add "(NNA09DA76A)" after "NASA Astrobiology Institute".

2. Please add the following sentence before "We thank the many people...":
"We thank Jacob Bean for his referee report and suggestions to exoplanets.org."
