\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

% Recent development in exoplanet discoveries
Since the first peer-reviewed list of exoplanets with robust orbits
\citep{Butler2002,Butler2006}, the count of exoplanets has increased
from less than 200 to over 1490 as of March 2014
(exoplanets.org). Before the launch of NASA's \kepler\ mission
\citep{Borucki2010}, most confirmed exoplanets were discovered via the
precise radial velocity (RV) method. However, since 2009, \kepler\ has
contributed over $\sim$ 800 confirmed exoplanets
\citep[e.g.,][]{Rowe2014} as well as over 3000 exoplanet candidates
(\kepler\ Objects of Interest, KOIs; e.g.~\citealt{Batalha2013}).

% The business of tracking planet discoveries
As the number of exoplanet discoveries keeps rising, it is important
to keep track of these discoveries and cataloging the orbital
parameters and host star properties of exoplanet systems. There are
several entities that are devoted to this effort, including the
Exoplanet Orbit Database (EOD) and Exoplanets Data Explorer\footnote{See
  \url{http://exoplanets.org}.} \citep{Wright2011}, the Extrasolar
Planets Encyclopaedia\footnote{See \url{http://exoplanet.eu}.}
\citep{Schneider2011}, the NASA Exoplanet Archive\footnote{See
  \url{http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu}.}
\citep{Akeson2013}, and so on.

% What is this paper about
This paper describes the continuing efforts since \cite{Wright2011} to
maintain the EOD and the Exoplanets Data Explorer at
exoplanets.org. The EOD has expanded to include all robustly-detected
exoplanets (around {\it any} type of host star) with well-determined
orbital parameters published in peer-reviewed literature. It has also
ingested more parameters of the exoplanet systems and host stars, and
some parameters are revised or deleted. We describe the updates with
the EOD in Section~\ref{sec:update}.

% also the website
We also describe the updates to the website that hosts the EOD and the
Exoplanet Data Explorer, exoplanets.org. As one of the mostly visited
exoplanet database, exoplanets.org had $47,000$ visitors in 2013
according to Google Analytics. The Exoplanet Data Explorer has
expanded its scope and now includes the \kepler\ exoplanet
candidates. We describe these changes in Section~\ref{sec:kepler}. The
website has also gone through major back-end changes since
\cite{Wright2011}, which is described in Section~\ref{sec:website}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Updates on the EOD}\label{sec:update}

Scope of EOD has changed in the following ways:

1. Definition of planets: not strictly smaller than 24 \mjup\ any
more? Or still true? We still require smaller than 24 \mjup.

2. Host stars: not only `normal stars' any more? Not any more -
neutron stars are there (at least)! This requirement is completely gone.

3. Change on definition of `well-determined' orbital parameters? No. Still
qualitative, still the same as described in Section~2 of \cite{Wright2011}.

4. Inclusion of planets discovered beyond RV and transit.

Purposes of EOD have not changed?

We only describe new additions and revised fields here, but list all
fields. For details on other fields, see \cite{Wright2011}. We divide
the fields into categories in consistency with the interactive table
on exoplanets.org. Some fields are not explicitly included in the
interactive table (e.g., the URLs), but are explicitly listed in the
downloadable {\tt .csv} file.\footnote{The entire dataset provided by
  exoplanets.org is available for download in a single CSV file at
  \url{http://exoplanets.org/csv-files/exoplanets.csv}} Make a note
here that though we focus on EOD in this Section, the fields apply to
all planets on exoplanets.org.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Discovery and References}

We report general information of when, by whom and how the planets were
discovered and provide the references. We describe the added fields since \cite{Wright2011} below.

{\bf KEPID} stands for KEPler ID which is the integer number assigned for a Kepler host star. KEPID is only available for the unconfirmed KOI which we import directly from the Exoplanet Archive. Therefore, none of the EOD planets and the confirmed Kepler planets has KEPID.


{\bf KOI} stands for Kepler Objects of Interest which is a star with transit signals detected by \kepler\ but have not been confirmed to due to exoplanets. The KOI field contains a floating point number that consist of a whole number designated to the host star followed by a decimal number denoting a candidate planet. For example, KOI 102 is a star suspected to host two exoplanets and KOI 102.01 is the inner planet candidate and KOI 102.02 is the outer one. Once a candidate is confirmed, the NAME field of the planet is replaced by the official \kepler\ ID ('Kepler' followed by a hyphen, an integer and a letter). The KOI number is used as OTHERNAME. None of the KOIs are in the EOD and for more information see Section~\ref{sec:kepler}. 

\begin{comment}
\textit {Sharon: you need to say what KOI stores. When writing each
  field, keep in mind you need to cover the following so that the
  reader will completely understand: (1) what the field stands for
  (e.g., in case of an abbreviation like KOI); (2) what the field
  physically means, like `KOI' means planet candidates that have transit
  signals as detected by \kepler\ but have not been confirmed, and
  make sure to be thorough at what you say -- sometimes things are not
  that obvious to an outsider reader, e.g., think if a cosmologist
  would understand what you're saying when reading it; (3) what the
  field actually contains, e.g. KOI contains the KOI number designated
  by the \kepler\ team (right?), it is a floating point number, and
  sometimes maybe even worth giving an example, e.g. KOI 30.1 or
  something...; (4) why we added this new field, if this information
  is helpful, or if it's a revised field since \cite{Wright2011}, what
  is changed. Also, use \kepler\ (which is a defined symbol in our ms.tex file),
  instead of typing out Kepler, since you need italic.
  Don't be afraid to write more! Being concise is important, but it's
  always easier to trim down things than to add things on, especially
  for a documentation type of paper like this. Let's be thorough at
  first, then try to reach optimal conciseness.}

KDE: obselete field! Detele from the table.

{\bf EOD} is a flag which indicates whether an exoplanet has well-characterized orbital parameters (e.g. period (PER)). EOD equals 1 means the exoplanet is in the EOD. We added this field because exoplanets.org now also includes robustly discovered planets that do not have well-characterized orbits, and also \kepler\ planet candidates (see Section~\ref{sec:kepler} for more details).


{\bf MICROLENSING, IMAGING, TIMING and ASTROMETRY} are flags which indicate that a planet detected via theses methods. For example, MICROLENSING $=$ 1 means the planet is detected by a microlensing event. However, we require the detection to be robust, as determined by the QUAlity Control Board of the Exoplanet Database, QUACBED. 


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Orbital Parameters}
We report the orbital parameters that determine the shape of the planet's orbit. Depending on the detection methods, different sets of parameters are given by the literatures. For instance, if a planet is detected by the radial velocity method, the semiamplitude, $K$, is reported whereas the inclination of the orbit, $i$, is reported by the transit method. 

We describe the added fields since \cite{Wright2011} below. 


{\bf MASS} is the mass of the planet in the unit of Jupiter mass. Previously, we only reported the minimum mass, ($m\sin{i}$, MSINI) of the planets. We now report the mass as well. For example, if a planet is discovered by microlensing, we report the actual mass of the planet according to the literature. 
If a planet has both radial velocity and transit measurements, we calculate the mass from the minimum mass and the orbital inclination. MASS is set to MSINI if the orbital inclination is not given and the MASSREF is set to ``Set to MSINI; I unknown''. 

ZZZ For KOIs without MSINI measured, we import the MASS fields from the Exoplanet Archive, which are derived from the mass-radius relation in . 


{\bf SEP} is the projected separation between the host star and the planet in the unit of AU. For directly imaged planets, the literatures give the projected separation and we report this value. There are cases where only the semi-major axis is given without the projected separation, then SEP is set to the semi-major axis. For the cases where only the projected separation is given such as imaged planets, then the semi-major axis is set to SEP. 

{\bf BIGOM} is the longitude of the ascending node, which together with other orbital parameters (PER, T0, K, OM, ECC and I) determines the the planet's orbit. 
ZZ why did we start reporting this?
We thought we would get them eventually but we haven't seen any paper that actually reports this.

{\bf LAMBDA} is the projected spin-orbit misalignment in the unit of degree. We report the projected spin-orbit misalignment of transiting systems, which is measured by Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. We follow the definition of Fabrycky and Winn 2009. The spin-orbit angle is defined to be the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbital axis. However, since the spin-orbit angle is not directly measurable, and therefore lambda, the projected spin-orbit angle was introduced. In the observer-oriented frame, Z axis points toward the observer, X axis points along the intersection of the sky plane and the planet's orbital plane, and Y axis completes a right handed-triad. Lambda is measured clockwise on the sky from the Y axis to the projected stellar rotational axis. While maintaining LAMBDA in our database, we figured out that literatures have conflicted definitions of LAMBDA with $\beta$, which is equal to $\lambda$ = -$\beta$. We sorted these cases out and made sure that LABDA is following the definition of Fabrycky and Winn 2009. 


{\bf I} is the orbital inclination. This field is not newly added but we chose to describe it here since our database now has the inclination for planets detected by methods other than transit. Previously, only transiting systems used to have the inclination measured. However, now sometimes for
non-transiting systems the values of I are also available. For instance, if the system was first detected by radial velocity and has a follow-up transit observation, then the inclination can be measured. To sum up, all the transiting planets have measured orbital inclination and currently, we also have one microlensing planet with measured inclination. *** give the example!



%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Transit Parameters}
We report the transit parameters of transiting planets. These parameters are available only when the planet has TRANSIT flag equal to 1. 
Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

{\bf DR} is the distance between the planet and the star during the transit in stellar radii. This is one of the parameters that goes into the transit light curve modeling and for more information, see Batalha 2013 for more details. 

{\bf RR} is the ratio of the planetary radius and the stellar radius. Previously, we only reported the transit depth, which is the square of the planetary radius and the stellar radius.
Why did we add this field? 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Secondary Eclipse}
We have added an entirely new set of fields for the secondary eclipse. To measure transits, astronomers need to have a precision of 1/100, whereas for the secondary eclipse (or transmission spectrum), precision of 1/10,000 is required, which means it is much harder to detect the secondary eclipse depths or transmission spectra compared to just transit. Previously, due to the limits of instrumentation, there were not much available measured secondary eclipse depths. However, since \cite{Wright2011}, as many different surveys have been launched, secondary eclipse depths at multiple bands are now available. Therefore, to better ingest this information, we added a new set of fields for the secondary eclipse. 

This is a entire new set of fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

{\bf SE} flag indicates whether the system has detected secondary eclipse in any of the 2MASS J, H, and K$_s$, Kepler photometry band, and 4 Spitzer IRAC bands. SE is a boolean and being true indicates the system has detected secondary eclipse. 

{\bf SEDEPTH J H KS KP 36 45 58 80} fields are the secondary eclipse depth measured in the corresponding wavelength band. J, K, and K$_s$ are the depth measured in the 2MASS wavelength band in near infrared each centered at 1.25\micron, 1.65\micron, and 2.15\micron, respectively. KP is the depth measured in the Kepler photometry band which is centered at 

{\bf SET} is the epoch of secondary eclipse center in HJD. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Stellar Properties}
ZZZ Stellar parameters and stellar properties have been merged. 

Stellar parameters section is consisted of 3 parts: Stellar properties, Stellar magnitudes, and Coordinates and Catalog. This section is to provide our users detailed information about the exoplanet hosting stars. Stellar properties section contains name, mass, and consistent set of metalicities (FE) , effective temperature (TEFF), surface gravity (LOGG), projected rotational velocity (VSINI), and the systematic radial velocity (GAMMA). Stellar magnitudes section includes optical magnitudes of the star (V and BMV) as well as 2MASS infrared (J, H, and K) and Kepler bandpass magnitude (KP). Coordinates and Catalog section includes the right ascension (RA) and the declination (DEC) of the host star, parallax (PAR) and distance (DIST) and the integers designated by different catalogs. 

Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:


{\bf GAMMA} is the newly added field under Stellar properties. It is the radial velocity of the center of mass of the planetary system and is reported in km/s.  


Difference from Stellar Parameters: these are derived parameters based
on spectroscopy and stellar models. 
Not always true for RSTAR because some literatures give the value. 
Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

{\bf RSTAR} is the radius of the star in the solar radius. 

{\bf RHOSTAR} is the density of the star in the unit of $g/cm^3$

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection {Stellar Magnitudes}

We provide the brightness of the host star measured in different wavelengths. We report optical magnitudes (V and B-V), 2MASS J,H, and K magnitudes centered at 1.25\micron, 1.65\micron, and 2.15\micron, respectively. 

Added field: 
{\bf KP} is the stellar magnitude measured through the Kepler bandpass which covers 4000 angstroms to 8500 angstroms. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Coordinates and Catalogs}
We report the coordinates of the host star as well as the stellar ID as designated by different catalogs. 
Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

{\bf DIST} is the distance of the host star in the unit of pc. It sometimes is calculated from the parallax that come from the Hipparcos data set by van Leeuwen (2009).


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Uncertainties}

We now report uncertainties for a certain field X as XUPPER, XLOWER
and UX. XUPPER and XLOWER store the upper and lower 1$\sigma$
uncertainties, and they are different when the error bars are
asymmetric. UX contains the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty, and it
equals to $({\rm XUPPER+XLOWER})/2$ in the case of asymmetric error
bars. Fields that have XUPPER, XLOWER and UX are: (list of fields).

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

The fields {\bf XREF} and {\bf XURL} store the peer-reviewed reference and link to
the publication for the field X. 

Added field: MONTH, PLANETDISCMETH, STARDISCMETH.
The following fields now have XREF and XURL: (previously in \cite{Wright2011}) DIST, TRANSIT, BINARY; (new) fields in stellar parameters: V, VSINI, GAMMA; all orbit pars except for trend and freeze\_ecc; all transit parameters; all SE parameters; fields for stellar properties: MSTAR, RSTAR, TEFF, RHOSTAR, LOGG, FE.

VREF is not the same as REF for J H KS, which do not have XREF
fields. See \cite{Wright2011} for references of J H KS mags -- I think
he mentioned it there.

Other general reference fields: In \cite{Wright2011}: FIRSTREF,
FIRSTURL, ORBREF, ORBURL. New: SPECREF, SPECURL contain source of most
of the spectroscopic parameters listed for convenience; actual
references in the REF fields take precedence over this one.

{\bf MONTH} field reports an integer of the month when the peer-reviewed paper is accepted to the
ApJ to better track of the trend in the exoplanet detections. 

{\bf PLANETDISCMENT} and {\bf STARDISCMETH} are the fields that report the discovery methods for the host star and the planet See Section~ for more details.  


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Revised and Removed Fields}
We have major updates by taking out some of the fields and by revising the existing fields. Here, we explain why we removed or revised such fields. 

{\bf OTHERNAME} - This is now listed as other name of planet instead of star;
** OTHTERNAME has always been the name of the star I think...?

{\bf DISCMETH} field previously reported the mouthed of discovery, which was either radial velocity or transit. We have replaced DISCMETH with {\bf PLANETDISCMETH} and {\bf STARDISCMETH} to better report how the host star and the planet are detected. Furthermore, they now have value of one of the following: radial velocity, transit, imaging, microlensing, timing, or astrometry.  

{\bf S} field previously reported the Mount Wilson Ca II S-value and now it is changed to SHK. 
; ZZZ What's the source for SHK and RHK? Still discovery paper and Butler 2006? ZZZ SHK is a poorly maintained field, and it is unreferenced at the moment though we plan to include proper reference
in the future.

{\bf SPSTAR} field previously reported the stellar type of the host star. We choose to remove this field because....? - stellar type of star (unvetted), gone;

{\bf NSTEDID} field reported ID of host star in NStED and now it is replaced by EANAME, which is the name of the star as appears on the Exoplanet Archive. 

{\bf MASSREF} and {\bf MASSURL} fields were used to report the reference and the url of stellar mass but now they are used for planet mass.

\section{Inclusion of the Kepler Planet Candidates and Other Exoplanets on Exoplanets.org}\label{sec:kepler}

Since \cite{Wright2011}, as more planets were discovered
by different methods other than radial velocity and transit, we have expanded this information to better ingest those planets into our database.

Planets primarily detected by these methods do not have robust orbital parameters, they are categorized as ``Other Planets'' on exoplanets.org. 

If planets have follow up radial velocity or transit observations and
thus have good orbital parameters, they have EOD flags. See
Section~\ref{sec:kepler} for more information about `Other Planets'. 


We now include \kepler\ candidates... They can be displayed by
checking the `Kepler' option for the interactive data table.

We also include robustly detected planets discovered microlensing,
imaging, timing, astrometric motion. They can be displayed by check
the `Other' option for the table. They are not included in the EOD
(especially some microlensing and imaging planets) because of poorly
characterized orbits...

Also add our criteria for vetting IMAGING planets, which can be found
here: http://exoplanets.org/methodology.html; do we have any similar
criteria for Microlensing, timing and astrometry planets? Like mass
cut etc.?

Figure: some comparison figures of Kepler candidate properties
vs. EOD planet properties, such as mass-period, mass-radius?
