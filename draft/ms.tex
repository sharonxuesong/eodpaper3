\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Recent development of exoplanet discoveries, especially
\kepler\ discoveries.

The business of keeping track of exoplanet discoveries, where EOD
stands, and a brief history of EOD.

What this paper is about: an update on EOD and the services our
website, exoplanets.org, provide.

According to Google Analytics, $47,000$ people visited exoplanets.org
in 2013.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Updates on the EOD}\label{sec:update}


Scope of EOD has changed in the following ways:

1. Definition of planets: not strictly smaller than 24 \mjup\ any
more? Or still true?

2. Host stars: not only `normal stars' any more?

3. Change on definition of `well-determined' orbital parameters?

4. Inclusion of planets discovered beyond RV and transit.

Purposes of EOD have not changed?

We only describe new additions and revised fields here, but list all
fields. For details on other fields, see \cite{Wright2011}. We divide
the fields into categories in consistency with the interactive table
on exoplanets.org. Some fields are not explicitly included in the
interactive table (e.g., the URLs), but are explicitly listed in the
downloadable {\tt .csv} file.\footnote{The entire dataset provided by
  exoplanets.org is available for download in a single CSV file at
  \url{http://exoplanets.org/csv-files/exoplanets.csv}}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Planet Information}

Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

KEPID

KOI

KDE

EOD: Planets discovered by radial velocity and transit method are classified as EOD planets. They have robust orbital parameters such as PER, ECC, K, OM, and I.

MICROLENSING, IMAGING, TIMING and ASTROMETRY: We have added MICROLENS- ING, IMAGING, TIMING and ASTROMETRY fields for planets discovered by methods other than radial velocity and transit. These planets are categorized as ``Other Planets'' on exoplanets.org

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Stellar Parameters}

Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

DIST: actually, DIST is not added since Wright 2011 (It was just left out)

GAMMA

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Orbit Parameters}

Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

MASS: Previously, we only reported the minimum mass (MSINI) of the planets. We now report mass of the planet in the unit of Jupiter mass. If a planet is discovered by transit, the planet mass is given by the literature. However, if a planet is detected by radial velocity method, the minimum mass is given in which case we calculate the mass by dividing the minimum mass by the orbit inclination. MASS is set to MSINI if the orbital inclination is not given and the MASSREF is set to ``Set to MSINI; I unknown''

MASS: we use mass-radius relation to get mass. =>stellar mass?

SEP

BIGOM

LAMBDA: the literature has conflicted definitions of LAMBDA, and we
sorted it out and made sure it is consistent in EOD.

LAMBDA: We report the projected spin-orbit misalignment of transiting systems. We follow the definition of Fabrycky and Winn 2009.

I: it used to be for transit systems only. Now sometimes for
non-transiting systems the values of I are also available.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Transit Parameters}

Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

DR

RR

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Secondary Eclipse}

This is a entire new set of fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

SE

SEDEPTH J H KS KP 36 45 58 80

SET

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Stellar Properties}

Difference from Stellar Parameters: these are derived parameters based
on spectroscopy and stellar models.
Added fields since \cite{Wright2011}:

RSTAR

RHOSTAR

KP

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Uncertainties}

We now report uncertainties for a certain field X as XUPPER, XLOWER
and UX. XUPPER and XLOWER store the upper and lower 1$\sigma$
uncertainties, and they are different when the error bars are
asymmetric. UX contains the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty, and it
equals to $({\rm XUPPER+XLOWER})/2$ in the case of asymmetric error
bars. Fields that have XUPPER, XLOWER and UX are: (list of fields).

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

Added field: MONTH, PLANETDISCMETH, STARDISCMETH.

The fields XREF and XURL store the peer-reviewed reference and link to
the publication for the field X. The following fields now have XREF
and XURL: (previously in \citealt{Wright2011}) DIST, TRANSIT, BINARY;
(new) fields in stellar parameters: V, VSINI, GAMMA; all orbit pars except for
trend and freeze\_ecc; all transit parameters; all SE parameters;
fields for stellar properties: MSTAR, RSTAR, TEFF, RHOSTAR, LOGG, FE.

VREF is not the same as REF for J H KS, which do not have XREF
fields. See \cite{Wright2011} for references of J H KS mags -- I think
he mentioned it there.

Other general reference fields: In \cite{Wright2011}: FIRSTREF,
FIRSTURL, ORBREF, ORBURL. New: SPECREF, SPECURL contain source of most
of the spectroscopic parameters listed for convenience; actual
references in the REF fields take precedence over this one.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Revised and Removed Fields}

These include:

OTHERNAME - This is now listed as other name of planet instead of star;

DISCMETH - replaced by planetdiscmeth and stardiscmeth;

S - changed to SHK; ZZZ What's the source for SHK and RHK? Still discovery
paper and Butler 2006? ZZZ SHK is a poorly maintained field, and it is
unreferenced at the moment though we plan to include propoer reference
in the future.

SPSTAR - stellar type of star (unvetted), gone;

NSTEDID - replaced by EANAME (Exoplanet Archive).

MASSREF, MASSURL - originally for stellar mass reference, now for planet mass.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure: Figure of single planet page, to show updated transit
parameters and RV curves etc.?


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Inclusion of the Kepler Planet Candidates and Other Exoplanets on Exoplanets.org}\label{sec:kepler}

We now include \kepler\ candidates... They can be displayed by
checking the `Kepler' option for the interactive data table.

We also include robustly detected planets discovered microlensing,
imaging, timing, astrometric motion. They can be displayed by check
the `Other' option for the table. They are not included in the EOD
(especially some microlensing and imaging planets) because of poorly
characterized orbits...

Figure: some comparison figures of Kepler candidate properties
vs. EOD planet properties, such as mass-period, mass-radius?
