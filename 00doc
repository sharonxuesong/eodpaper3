	Basic Commands for Updating Draft
#############################################################
0. Pull from repository, resolve and merge conflicts, if any.
$ git pull origin master
If there were conflicts and you resolved them, push first.
If not sure about conflicts, just do whatever you want locally, and we can sit down and resolve the conflicts together some other time.
1. Finish all the changes you want to make with ms.tex, and then generate LaTex pdf: ('$' symbol stands for terminal commands)
$ make
2. Clean all the LaTex secondary products before you commit to git locally:
$ make clean
$ git commit -am "Enter your documentation on what you did. No name needed."
3. Push to remote:
$ git push origin master

	Add New Literature Reference
#############################################################
1. Find the paper you want to add as reference on ADS in a listing format (not the page where you see just this paper; see below on how to get the right format if you can only locate this paper on its page).
2. Select it and scroll down, enter the following code in Custom format:
\\bibitem[%\2m%(y)]\{%za1%y} %\8l %\Y,%\j,%\V,%\p\n
3. Click 'Retrieve selected record', you'll see something like this in the displayed screen or downloaded file:
\bibitem[Schneider et al.(2011)]{Schneider2011} Schneider, J., Dedieu, C., 
Le Sidaner, P., Savalle, R., \& Zolotukhin, I.\ 2011, \aap, 532, A79
4. Add this /bibitem entry into the file /draft/references.tex. Note that the papers are ordered by first author alphabetically.

If you only have the paper opened on its own page (example: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...532A..79S), then if you scroll down you'll see 'Preferred format for this abstract (see Preferences)'below the abstract.
Click on 'Preferences', and set your preferences (this requires you login to ADS). Go down a little bit and you'll see 'Reference Format', where you have a lot of choices, like 'Default format', 'generic tagged abstracts' etc. Select Custom format  and enter the code below in the provided space:
\\bibitem[%\2m%(y)]\{%za1%y} %\8l %\Y,%\j,%\V,%\p\n
Save your preference.
In the future, on a single paper page, you can just click on "Preferred format for this abstract", and the desired format of bibliography will show up.

This format is ApJ format. I set it just because when you reference the paper, you don't have to use \cite{2011A%26A...532A..79S}, which is ugly and long and impossible to remember. But instead, this format allows you to cite papers by \cite{Schneider2011}, i.e. first author and year. This way you don't have to look up the ADS code to cite papers!
